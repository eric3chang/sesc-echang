Eric,

A few comments on what you submitted:

* In general, I think it will help you to write an
  outline of the text before actually writing the text.
  You need to "play" with the flow of the text
  to make sure that it is strictly top-down and
  avoids repetition.

* The protocols you are looking at are not really directly
  applicable to CMPs (chip multiprocessors) but were
  designed for older systems.  In particular, note that
  with the Origin 2000 there is part of main memory with
  every node.  This is not the case on a CMP.
  The way you can "adapt" the Origin 2000 protocol to CMPs
  is to consider a CMP where the last-level cache
  is distributed across the nodes (cores) and you are
  ignoring misses from the last-level cache.
  So, if you want to talk about CMPs, you will need
  to explain the "mapping" of the Origin 2000 protocol
  to CMPs along the lines of the text above.

* There are no "ideologies" behind different protocols.

* The introduction needs to provide details about what
  you have actually done -- this is the critical part
  of the intro.  In addition, it needs to provide a
  "roadmap" for the rest of the report.
  Look at published papers for examples of what
  you need in the intro.

* I assume that the material in the Background section
  is based on a textbook.  You need to cite your references.
  Obviously, this also includes the paper about
  the Origin system.

* Do a search for "stages" -- in at least one place you
  use "stages" instead of "states".

* Before you get into the details of the protocols, you
  need to set the stage by explaining that a coherence
  protocol involves maintaining states for the blocks
  in the caches as well as request and reply message
  types exchanged among the nodes of the system.
  You should then explain the basic states as well
  as the basic message types.

* Why do you need a section "snoopy vs. directory-based"?
  Just have a section where you very briefly discuss
  snoopy and dismiss it as not interesting (scalable).
  Then start discussing directory-based in a different section.
  The current presentation is very confusing.

* The top of page 4 is misleading.  With snoopy protocols,
  there is no 1-1 communication -- every message (transaction)
  is broadcast to all the nodes.

* When you begin discussing directory-based protocols you
  must do so top-down.  First, explain what is the directory,
  what information is stored there, how is this information used.
  Only then can you get into details.
