- to eliminate "destructor not called" error, use #include instead of forward declaration. basically, we have to include the class before calling the destructor
- check Events.cpp for synchronization routines
- For all the cache structures, we have hitDelay and missDelay. hitDelay is the time that it takes to return the data (data + tag access). missDelay is the time that it takes to detect a cache miss (tag). Most L1 caches, the hitDelay is the same as the misDelay. This is not true for L2 caches, and for other cache configuration (phased cache).
- use lion or osprey to run simulations. lion is a 8-core system with 12GB of memory
- src/libapp contains files related to compiling custom multi-threaded programs
- - use smalltest for SYNTHETIC BENCHMARK
- nothing useful in libvmem
- print *(iter._M_current)   // command to print the current iterator in gdb
- use the following splash2 benchmarks:
- - kernel: cholesky, fft, lu, radix
- - apps: Ocean, fmm : only these two provide correct.out
- - Matt got Barnes, Radix, Raytrace, Ocean, FFT, Cholesky and FMM to work
- use -yINT to run only INT number of instructions
- start at 4 processors, 8k L1 cache, 16k L2 cache
