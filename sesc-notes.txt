- only need to include .cpp files inside cmake add_executable and add_library commands
- to eliminate "destructor not called" error, use #include instead of forward declaration. basically, we have to include the class before calling the destructor
- RunFile.txt contains sample ways to run the program
- check Events.cpp for synchronization routines
- For all the cache structures, we have hitDelay and missDelay. hitDelay is the time that it takes to return the data (data + tag access). missDelay is the time that it takes to detect a cache miss (tag). Most L1 caches, the hitDelay is the same as the misDelay. This is not true for L2 caches, and for other cache configuration (phased cache).
- use lion to run simulations. lion is a 8-core system with 12GB of memory
- src/libapp contains files related to compiling custom multi-threaded
  programs
- use DebugFail(), DebugAssert(), fatal() to indicate error conditions
- Connection - Local means sending something towards CPU. Remote means sending
  data away from CPU towards the network or main memory.
- only need to modify genome__64_1_8_2_Perfect.conf_0 type files and .memory
  files
- nothing useful in libvmem
- run benchmark on regular machine, store the result, then run the benchmark
  inside sesc simulator, then compare if the results are correct.
- efence vs valgrind
- gcc -S [filename].c produces disassembly
2010/08/25 - use yada-dots for testing OnRemoteInvalidateResponse error because it's the smallest
- use the following splash2 benchmarks:
-- kernel: cholesky, fft, lu, radix
-- apps: Ocean, fmm : only these two provide correct.out
-- print *(iter._M_current)   // command to print the current iterator in gdb
