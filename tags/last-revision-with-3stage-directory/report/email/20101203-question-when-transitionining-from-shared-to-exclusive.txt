Re:
   The scenario you describe is possible.
   The description in the paper does not really cover this situation.
   It seems to me that this problem can be solved by having
   the requestor transition to a "busy" state after sending the
   original request and having this state persist until
   it transitions to exclusive state in step 6c.
   Any intervention requests arriving while the block is
   in this "busy" state should be NACKed.

I have attached two files indicating the changes I made to handle this last case. Fsm-directory.pdf indicates the directory's actions and fsm-other.pdf indicates the requester's actions. The relevant changes are colored in red. Is this what you meant in your comments?
