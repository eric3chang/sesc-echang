Dear Professor:

I have reattached the fsms with explanations for each underneath. I was not sure as to what degree and what type of detail I should provide with the fsms. I feel that it is more appropriate to use a paragraph form instead of a list form, where I would have a list of states and explanations for each states. The form I have provided here is what I called paragraph form. In addition, I was not sure whether or not I needed to provide a fsm for the design portion of my report. The fsms I have here are drawn with implementation taken into account. If I followed the design on the paper directly, I do not think I would need to include any of the actions regarding storing and clearing requests. Also, I wasn't sure if I shouuld have split the fsms into read request, write request, and remote-read/invalidate request, but I felt that it was more compact if I combined them all into one fsm, since that is the way that it will be implemented.

I also attached my original question below that I had about implementing the transition from the Shared state to the Exclusive state.

Re:
   The scenario you describe is possible.
   The description in the paper does not really cover this situation.
   It seems to me that this problem can be solved by having
   the requestor transition to a "busy" state after sending the
   original request and having this state persist until
   it transitions to exclusive state in step 6c.
   Any intervention requests arriving while the block is
   in this "busy" state should be NACKed.

I have attached two files indicating the changes I made to handle this last case. Fsm-directory.pdf indicates the directory's actions and fsm-requester-owner-sharer.pdf indicates the requester, owner, and sharer's actions. The relevant changes are colored in red. Is this what you meant in your comments above?
