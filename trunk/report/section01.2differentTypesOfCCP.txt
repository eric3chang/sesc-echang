Section 02 Different Types of Cache Coherence Protocols
There are two main types of cache coherence protocols - Directory based and
snooping. A third one is available on Wikipedia. In my report, we will focuson
directory-based cache coherence protocols and what they bring to the table. 

There are several cache-coherence protocols. 

When it comes to cache-coherence, there are several types. There is the
directory-based cache-coherence protocl, first invented in 

In this report, I will talk about
different directory-based protocols and how they compare against each other. 

Snoopy-based protocols have an advantage when it comes to manufacturing
because they can use the existing bus to memory as the broadcast medium for
communicating information about cache coherence (Hennessey 208). However, from
the results in the following table, we can see that a snoopy-based protocol is
not as scalable as a directory-based protocol. So in my report, we will check
out various directory-based protocols
