Title: An Implementation of the standard directory-based cache-coherence
protocol on the SESC simulator

Comparing different directory-based cache coherence protocols.

Section 1

The user-defined values could be contained in the configuration file or passed
on the command-line like the other parameters. The configuration file is read
through OSSim.cpp file under the libcore folder. It is read into a SescConf
variable. I will design the SimpleDirectoryController in a way so that most of
the common parameters will be changeable through the header file. The most
obvious parameter that comes to mind is the directory size parameter, but more
options will be added as necessary to increase the flexibility of the
simulator. Some of the parameters that will need to be tracked are how many
accesses to the directory are being made, how many reads and writes to the
directory, and so on.

Section 01-2
"In a coherent multiprocessor, the caches provide both migration and replication of shared data items" (Hennessey 207). It is important for the architect of the processor to design these features into the processor as to allow the programmer to take advantage of the speedup available in having multiple data. Having multiple data allows for multiple reads at the same time.
