- only need to include .cpp files inside cmake add_executable and add_library commands
- to eliminate "destructor not called" error, use #include instead of forward declaration. basically, we have to include the class before calling the destructor
- RunFile.txt contains sample ways to run the program
- check Events.cpp for synchronization routines
- For all the cache structures, we have hitDelay and missDelay. hitDelay is the time that it takes to return the data (data + tag access). missDelay is the time that it takes to detect a cache miss (tag). Most L1 caches, the hitDelay is the same as the misDelay. This is not true for L2 caches, and for other cache configuration (phased cache).
